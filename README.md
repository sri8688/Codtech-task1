TASK 1
TITLE: CodTech IT Solutions Internship - Task Documentation: "CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES" Using PYTHON.
INTERN INFORMATION:
NAME: DOLA SRILATHA
ID: ICOD6709
#INTRODUCTION:
This project implements a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. The chatbot uses if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This project provides a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

IMPLEMENTATION
The chatbot is implemented in Python and runs in the command-line interface (CLI). It consists of a single Python script chatbot.py. The implementation defines a set of rules or patterns for user inputs and corresponding responses.

# General Chatbot

Welcome to the General Chatbot repository! This is a simple chatbot application built using Python, Streamlit, and Wikipedia API.

## About

This chatbot is designed to answer basic questions, provide information about various topics, and engage in casual conversation. It uses Wikipedia as a knowledge base to retrieve information on a wide range of subjects.

## Features

- **Question Answering**: The chatbot can respond to general questions such as greetings, personal information, and queries about various topics.
- **Wikipedia Integration**: It leverages the Wikipedia API to fetch relevant information based on user queries.
- **Streamlit Interface**: The user interface is built using Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the chatbot through a web browser.

## Installation

To run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```
    pip install regex streamlit wikipedia
    ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
4. Run the application using Streamlit:
    ```
    streamlit run chatterbot.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the provided interface. Simply type your question or message in the text input field and click "Send" to receive a response.

## Contribution

Contributions to improve the chatbot or add new features are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed modifications.

CONCLUSION:
This simple chatbot project demonstrates how to create a rule-based conversational agent that responds to user inputs. By defining specific rules or patterns and corresponding responses, the chatbot can engage in basic conversations and provide information or assistance to users.
